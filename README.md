# Go Echo Practice
My personal project to learn Go & Echo

The goal is to build a [fastify-esbuild](https://github.com/davipon/fastify-esbuild) clone (RESTful API) with docker build.

## How to start

Clone the project and install [`air`](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air), a live-reloading tool for Go apps:

`go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest`

To start the app, simply run the `air` command:

`air`
